# @contrast/protobuf-api

Generated `google-protobuf` models for Contrast Service communication.

# Build
This repo has a submodule to agent-service-api. That is where the protobuf models
exist.  If there are changes made that we need to re-compile our js protobuf models,
run the following:

```
npm run build
```
